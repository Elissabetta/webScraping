# webScraping

**My Web Scraping Playground!**

Here we try out:
- R using Xpath
- Python
- Build an app in modern JavaScript with Google Apps*

Currently developing a webscrapitng application capable of Scraping and compiling the complete teaching schedule given a professor's web page. 
Updating me via email if the professor teaching schedule changes.

*Apps Script is a cloud-based JavaScript platform that lets you integrate with and automate tasks across Google products.
